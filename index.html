Write a nested for loop to generate all combinations of two arrays: firstNames = ["Lil", "Big"] and lastNames = ["Zzz", "Boom"].
Explain how many times the inner loop runs if the outer loop runs 3 times and the inner loop runs 2 times.
Modify the nested loop to only generate names where both indexes are not the same.

Chapter 21 – Changing case

Write a program to convert a user’s input into lowercase and display it.
Use toUpperCase() to normalize city names before comparison.
Explain the importance of changing case in user input validation.

Chapter 22 – Strings: measuring length and extracting parts

Write a script to extract the first 5 characters from the string "JavaScriptRocks".
Get the last character of any user-provided string.
Ask the user to input their full name and display the length of the input.

Chapter 23 – Strings: finding segments

Use indexOf to find the position of “dog” in "The lazy dog sleeps.".
Write a script that checks if the word “hello” exists in user input.
How does indexOf behave if the string isn’t found?

Chapter 24 – Strings: finding a character at a location

Write a script to find the character at position 4 in the word “JavaScript”.
Ask a user for a string and a position; return the character at that position.

Demonstrate rounding 2.6 using Math.round, Math.floor, and Math.ceil.
Ask the user to input a number and round it to the nearest integer.
Compare Math.floor(-2.9) and Math.ceil(-2.9). Explain the difference.

Chapter 27 – Generating random numbers

Generate a random number between 1 and 6 (like a dice roll).
Write a coin toss simulator using Math.random().
Simulate a random password generator that picks a number between 1000 and 9999.

Use .toFixed(2) to display only 2 decimal places of 123.45678.
How would you convert "12.999" to a number and round it to 1 decimal?
Ask the user to input a decimal and display it rounded to 3 decimal places.

Chapter 31 – Getting the current date and time

Write a script to display the current date and time using new Date().
Extract and display only the year from the current date.
